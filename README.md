# CFC: ClueforClueless

A platform for clueless people who want to get something done in terms of career but don't know what to do, where to start.

We will have a questionnaire that the user answers based on which, we make recommendations for career paths (roadmaps) and list/suggest relevant courses (like a course marketplace).
